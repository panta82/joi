# joi

----------------

This is a private fork of joi.

It has the following changes over the original:
- Empty strings are no longer treated as errors.
- Joi.string() typing is now generic, allowing you to specify a typescript tuple as string type.

This repository is published to NPM as: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pantas-net/joi

The rest of the file is the same as upstream.

----------------

#### The most powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript.
